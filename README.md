# FCC Backend Projects

A curated collection of 5 backend microservices built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** as part of the **FreeCodeCamp Backend Certification**. Each project focuses on solving a specific real-world API challenge—from parsing headers to timestamp conversion, file metadata analysis to exercise tracking.

### 📦 Projects

| Project                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Exercise Tracker**     | Log workouts and retrieve user-specific exercise logs. |
| **File Metadata API**    | Upload a file and get back metadata like name, type, and size. |
| **Header Parser API**    | Parses and returns request headers like IP, language, and software info. |
| **Timestamp Microservice** | Converts human-readable or UNIX timestamps to both formats. |
| **URL Shortener API**    | A simple URL shortening service with redirect capability. |

💡 Each of these projects runs as an independent Express server and is deployable as a microservice. They’re lightweight, practical, and built for learning by doing.
